# AI and Machine Learning Portfolio 👋

Hey there! I'm Muhammad Zahid, a machine learning enthusiast who geeked out over neural networks long before it was cool. This portfolio is my playground for building AI solutions that actually make a difference in the real world. Think of it as part of lab notebook, part of trophy case—where code meets creativity to solve business puzzles.

**Fun fact**: I once trained a model to predict pizza delivery times during a snowstorm. (Spoiler: it learned that pepperoni waits for no one! 🍕)

## Introduction

Here's the deal—I believe AI shouldn't just live in research papers. Every line of code I write is about making machines *get* humans better. Whether it's helping companies keep their customers happy or teaching computers to see patterns we miss, I'm all about practical magic in the ML world.

My journey started when [insert brief personal anecdote, e.g., "I tried teaching my laptop to recognize my dog vs. pizza boxes... with mixed success"]. Now I'm hooked on creating AI tools that:

- 🎯 Solve actual business headaches
- 📈 Make data useful, not just pretty
- 🤖 Learn and adapt like a curious intern

## Projects

### 1. Stock Trade Risk Analysis 🔮
**The "Don't Leave Me" Machine**
Built a model that spots customers eyeing the exit door before they bail. Used Python's usual suspects (Langchain, OpenRouter, CrewAI) to crunch historical data.
*Why it matters*: One client reduced churn by 18% by using these predictions to target retention efforts.

### 2. Event Planner and Marketer 🎭
**Venue Decoder 3000**
AI agents automate venue selection, optimize crowd logistics ("200 people ≠ coffee shop math"), and launch targeted promotions. Includes a Logistics Ninja for real-time tweaks and a Hype Architect that designs viral campaigns using attendee data.

### 3. Simple Chatbot:
Basic LangChain-OpenRouter integration for straightforward Q&A, perfect for simple dialog management and quick information retrieval.

### 4.  Streaming Chatbot:
Real-time response streaming with typing indicators, ideal for dynamic conversations and fluid user experiences.

### 5 Multi-Model Persistent Chat:
Switch between LLMs mid-conversation, save chat histories, and resume sessions with model-specific contexts intact.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

**My Daily Drivers**
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning drama
- Scikit-Learn for classic ML heavy lifting
- PyTorch when I need that extra flexibility
- Crew Ai to team-up ai agents
- Langchain for apps that can reason.
- Streamlit
- OpenRouter API

**Cloud Kitchen**
AWS, Google Cloud, Azure—I've cooked up solutions in all of them

**Data Playground**
Coming soon..
Jupyter Notebooks (with coffee stains), Docker containers that actually work, and Git commits that say "fixed thing" (I'm working on it)

## Getting Started 🚀

Want to poke around? Here's how:

1. **Grab the goods**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ansarissab/AIML.git
   cd AIML
   ```

2. **Set up your sandbox**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv aivenv
   source aivenv/bin/activate  # Windows folks: aivenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the magic potions**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Pro tip: Start with the Stock Trade Risk Analysis got the best risk analysis.
